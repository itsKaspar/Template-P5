# Template P5
Project template for p5.js projects

## Things that need to be changed when creating a new project

- the js/Something.js ( it's class and exports )
- the package.json ( it's github links, and min names, project name)
- the build file names
- the main.js ( the export lines )
- the index.html (title and link to min)
- this README.md

# Unless  

This could all be avoided if I created a generator script

# things I could add
